# English Proficiency, Approaches to Learning, and the Moderating Role of Student-Teacher Relationships

## Scope of Analysis
Scientific literature on Multilingual students documents disparate achievement outcomes for those with lower English proficiency. However, past analyses have not considered external factors such as indicators of the classroom quality. Student-teacher relationships has often been overlooked when predicting student achievement outcomes, particularly for multilingual students. This analysis aims to explore the degree to which student-teacher relationships explains the differences in achievement patterns students low and high English proficiency.

## Data

This project focuses on the Spanish-English multilingual student subsample (n= 1200+) of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study 2011 cohort. This is a nationally representative dataset collected by the National Center of Education Statistics <https://nces.ed.gov/ecls/datainformation2011.asp> 

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this analysis are to:
1. Replicate findings from 1999 with the most recently available data to deepen the knowledge base of diverse student populations.
2. Investigate if patterns reported for general multilingual populations exist among Spanish-English multinguals to identify their learning needs.
3. Generate findings that inform culturally and lingusitcally responsive teaching strategies

### Requirements

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development/analysis env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using. It is also worth listing what the requirements are.
