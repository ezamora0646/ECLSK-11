## Scope of Analysis
Scientific literature on Multilingual students documents ***disparate achievement outcomes*** for those with lower English proficiency. However, past analyses have not considered external factors such as indicators of the classroom quality. ***Student-teacher relationships have often been overlooked*** when predicting student achievement outcomes, particularly for multilingual students. This analysis aims to explore the degree to which student-teacher relationships ***explains the differences in achievement patterns*** for students with low and high English proficiency.

## Dataset & Overview of Data Structure

This project focuses on the Spanish-English multilingual student subsample (n= 1200+) of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study 2011 (ECLS-K:2011) cohort. This is a nationally representative dataset collected by the National Center of Education Statistics <https://nces.ed.gov/ecls/datainformation2011.asp> 

ECLS-K:2011 contains records of over 18,000 students from 1,300 schools across the country. Data collected ranges from direct assessments, teacher surveys, and parent surveys. The outcome of interest is students' Approaches to Learning (ATL) ratings.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this analysis are to:
1. Replicate findings from 1999 with the most recently available data (2010-2012) to deepen the knowledge base of diverse student populations.
2. Investigate if patterns reported for general multilingual populations exist among Spanish-English multinguals to identify their learning needs.
3. Generate findings that inform culturally and lingusitcally responsive teaching strategies.

## Executive Summary

In kindergarten (2010-11) female gender (1.45), higher scores in fall ATL (2.80), attentional focus (1.44), as well as closeness (2.77) all increase a student’s odds of receiving a high ATL rating in the spring. 
First grade (2011-12) data ***does not indicate*** relationship scores as a moderator of the relationship between English proficiency and ATL ratings. Students with higher conflict were 0.27 times less likely to recieve a high ATL rating. While greater age (1.06 ), female gender (1.39 ), and higher attentional focus (1.35 ) scores were associated with increased likelihood of reciving a high ATL rating.
These findings highlight that students' language status is not a primary predictor of academic achievement. Further analyses should turn to teacher's structure of the classroom and the ways in which it affects students' engagement
